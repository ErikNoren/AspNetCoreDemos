# AspNetCoreDemos
This project contains sample ASP.NET Core web applications demonstrating different features in their most basic form.
Unless otherwise stated, these examples are based on ASP.NET Core 1.1 specifically to differentiate from older samples
based on 1.0 RC2 which can be quite out of date.

The 1.1 libraries introduce new features and improvements which make ASP.NET Core a compelling option for .NET Developers.
As new versions are released I may update these samples but only if the updates alter the concepts presented.

When looking through these samples if you encounter anything unfamiliar check out the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/).
They are incredible and continue to [improve with contributions](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs).
